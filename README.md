This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped
with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Work Process

[//]: # (I want to describe the process of work implementing figma desgin in a component with tailwindcss and nextjs)

## Figma

[//]: # (ordred list )


1- Understand the design & the requirements ( Extract the big picture  :  structure of the design )

2-extract the colors & fonts & sizes & spacings & etc from the design

# Tailwindcss

- Install tailwindcss
- configure tailwindcss
- implement the design with tailwindcss (colors & fonts & sizes & spacings & etc)

# Nextjs

- created the page
- implement the design with tailwindcss (colors & fonts & sizes & spacings & etc) which is already configured
- adapt the responsive design

## Challenges

- New to tailwindcss so it took me some time to understand how it works and to understand utilities classes
- Not a fan of the tailwindcss stuff & mockups implementation (I prefer to use styled-components)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed
on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited
in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated
as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and
load Inter, a custom Google Font.
